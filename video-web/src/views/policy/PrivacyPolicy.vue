    <p>American Muslim Today recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of your personal information, and we
      have prepared this Privacy Policy to provide you with important information about our privacy practices. This
      Privacy Policy applies when you use a website, mobile or tablet application, or other online service
      (collectively, the “Services”) that links or refers to it. It does not govern or apply to information collected or
      used by American Muslim Today through other means.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers the following:</p>
    <p><b><i>Information We Collect</i></b></p>
    <p>We may collect personal information about our users in various ways. For example, we may collect information that
      you provide to us, information that we collect through your use of the Services, and information that we collect
      from publicly available sources or third parties.</p>
    <p><b>Information You Provide to Us. </b>When you register or otherwise interact with the Services, you may be
      invited to provide personal information to enhance your experience on the Services. For example:</p>
    <ul id="info-list1">
      <li>During account registration, if you order products from us or if you participate in a contest, promotion or
        survey, we may ask for:<br> - Contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, street address.<br> -
        Demographic information, such as year of birth, gender and street address.<br> - Professional Information, such
        as job title and industry and related information.<br> - Payment information, such as your credit card number
        and expiration date, where appropriate to process a financial transaction you have requested.</li>
      <li>User-Generated Content: Such as when you comment on articles, participate in message boards, and submit
        images, photos, videos, or other content to the Services, when you enter a contest or participate in a
        promotion, when you post an online ad, or otherwise engage with the Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Automatically Collected Information. </b>In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may
      collect information about your use of the Services or your device. As discussed further below, we and our service
      providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf), may use cookies, web beacons, and other
      technologies, which can be found in the Online Tracking and Advertising section below to assist in collecting this
      information.</p>
    <p>For example, we may collect:</p>
    <ul id="info-list2">
      <li><i>Device information</i> - such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers,
        operating system version, browser type and settings, such as language and available font settings, and settings
        of the device you use to access the Services.</li>
      <li><i>Usage information</i> — such as information about the Services you use, the time and duration of your use
        of the Services and other information about your interaction with content offered through a Service, and any
        information stored using cookies, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies that we have set on your
        device.</li>
      <li><i>Location information</i> - such as your computer’s IP address, your mobile device’s GPS signal or
        information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain
        Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Information From Third-Party Sources. </b>We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially
      available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you.
      For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through
      that site, and we may obtain demographic or interest data from consumer data resellers.</p>
    <p><b>Other Information We Collect. </b>We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use of
      the services in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent. You may
      choose not to provide us with certain types of information, but doing so may affect your ability to use some of
      the Services.</p>
    <p><b><i>How We Use Information</i></b></p>
    <p><b>To Provide and Manage the Services You Request. </b>This includes, for example, processing your subscription,
      sending you electronic newsletters, or enabling you to participate in the features provided by the Services. It
      also includes providing personalized content and recommendations to you, including by email. Through such
      features, we are able to bring you information and content tailored to your individual interests and needs.</p>
    <p><b>To Contact You. </b>We may periodically contact you with offers and information about the Services and our
      affiliates, including in connection with your accounts, online surveys, legal notices, news stories, new features
      that you are entitled to access, and other important information. You may opt out of receiving commercial email
      messages from us by following the instructions contained in those email messages.</p>
    <p><b>To Deliver Targeted Advertising. </b>We may use your information to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads,
      promotions, and offers to you, on behalf of ourselves and advertisers, on and off the Services. Please see the
      Online Tracking and Advertising section for further information about our and third parties’ use of cookies, web
      beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and other tracking technologies to provide you relevant ads, as well as
      information about how to disable cookies and make other choices related to targeted advertising.</p>
    <p><b>To Better Understand Our Readers and Users. </b>The Services conduct research on our users’ demographics,
      interests and behavior based on the information we collect. We do this to better understand and serve our users,
      and to improve our Services.</p>
    <p><b>Bug detection and error reporting. </b>We use information to understand and resolve technical issues, app
      crashes and other issues being reported.</p>
    <p><b>Audit consumer interactions on the Services. </b>We use information to measure the placement, frequency,
      efficacy and compliance of advertising and ad impressions.</p>
    <p><b>To Protect the Rights of the Services and others. </b>We may use your personal information as we believe is
      necessary or appropriate to secure, protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of
      the Services, its employees or agents, or other users and to comply with applicable law.</p>
    <p><b>Consent. </b>We may otherwise use your information with your consent or at your direction.</p>
    <p><b><i>Sharing of Information</i></b></p>
    <p>The following provides information about entities with which we may share information. Our practices vary
      depending on the type of information.</p>
    <p><b>Affiliates. </b>We may share information within our family of affiliated companies.</p>
    <p><b>Business Partners. </b>We may also share your information with business partners to provide you with services
      that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or
      co-sponsored by another company, your information may be shared with that sponsor. American Muslim Today is not
      responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.</p>
    <p><b>Service Providers. </b>We may share information with vendors providing contractual services to us, such as
      hosting vendors, advertising service providers, and list managers. We also may share your information, including
      your payment information, as appropriate to process your payments for the Services or complete a transaction.</p>
    <p><b>Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services. </b>We may share your
      personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights,
      privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users or to comply with applicable law or
      legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.</p>
    <p><b>Logging In Through Social Media Services. </b> If you log into the Services with a social media service or if
      you connect a social media account with the Services, we may share your information with that social media
      service. The social media services’ use of the shared information will be governed by the social media services’
      privacy policy and your social media account settings. If you do not want your information shared in this way, do
      not connect your social media account with your Services.</p>
    <p><b>Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality. </b>When you use our Services, third
      parties may collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of the Services (e.g., hashed data,
      clickstream information, browser type, time and date, information about your interactions with advertisements and
      other content), including through the use of cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies, in
      order to provide content, advertising, or functionality or to measure and analyze ad performance, on our Services
      or other websites or platforms. This information may be combined with information collected across different
      websites, online services, and other linked or associated devices. These third parties may use your information to
      improve their own services and consistent with their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p><b>Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction. </b>We reserve the right to transfer any information
      we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third
      party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.</p>
    <p><b>Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction. </b>In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy
      Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.</p>
    <p>We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users,
      including, for example, aggregated data about how users are using our Services.</p>
    <p><b><i>Embedded Content and Links to Third-Party Sites and Services</i></b></p>
    <p>Our Services may embed content from, or link to, third-party websites and services, including social media
      platforms, that are outside of our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information
      collected by other websites or other services. This Privacy Policy does not govern these third party’s content or
      services, and we encourage you to review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and
      services you use.</p>
    <p><b><i>How to Access or Update Your Information &amp; Other Privacy Choices Available To You</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Email Promotions. </b>You may opt out of receiving commercial email messages from us by following the
      instructions contained in those email messages.</p>
    <p><b>Other Choices. </b>The local laws where you live (e.g., laws of the E.U. and California) may permit you to
      make certain requests. See the section applicable to the place of your residency below.</p>
    <p><b>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. </b>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the
      websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate
      this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they
      even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites
      should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals.
      If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the
      meantime, please see Online Tracking &amp; Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may
      be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.</p>
    <p><b><i>Data Security</i></b></p>
    <p>We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.
      However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
      of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being
      transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
    <p><b>Children’s Privacy. </b>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16
      without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us
      with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.</p>

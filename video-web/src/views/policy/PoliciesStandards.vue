    <p><b><i>Ethics Policy</i></b></p>
    <ul id="Ethics-list">
      <li>To tell the truth and faithfully represent and report on American Muslim values and issues of concern and
        interest.</li>
      <li>To be independent of any vested interests and put our duty to the public and our readers first.</li>
      <li>To avoid conflict of interest that will unfairly influence our journalism. AMT staff will not accept gifts of
        favors from news sources.</li>
      <li>To be fair, balanced and honest in our reporting and writing.</li>
      <li>To avoid profanities and obscenities or any graphic content unless it’s deemed crucial to the story and in
        that case we will issue a warning.</li>
      <li>To separate opinion and editorial pages from news columns to ensure facts are clearly signposted although news
        may also have honest in depth reporting, analysis and commentary.</li>
      <li>To ensure our journalists use social media in a way that maintains the professional integrity of AMT, and
        ensure social, religious or political bias does not impede our commitment to journalistic fairness. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>AMT Verification and fact-checking standards</i></b></p>
    <p>Writers/reporters have primary responsibility for reporting, writing, and fact-checking their stories. Stories
      are subject to review by one or more editors. </p>
    <p><b><i>Diversity policy</i></b></p>
    <p>Diversity is at the core of AMT journalism. We want our staff to reflect America which is a proud nation of
      immigrants - religon has no racial barrier and we welcome non-Muslims writers and journalists who can gain insight
      into the American Muslim perspective by working for AMT.</p>
    <p><b><i>Ownership structure</i></b></p>
    <p>AMT is owned by Oracle Multi-Media.</p>
    <p><b><i>Corrections policy</i></b></p>
    <p>AMT strives for a fair, balanced and accurate news reporting. We endeavor to be promptly responsive in correcting
      errors in material published on our digital platform. When we run a correction, clarification or editor’s note,
      our goal is to do this as quickly and clearly as possible.</p>
    <p><b><i>Updating a digital report</i></b></p>
    <p>News stories will be updated if it is a developing story—this update does not need to be recorded unless there
      was a significant error which requires some form of correction.</p>
    <p><b><i>Corrections</i></b></p>
    <p>If we are substantively correcting an article, photo caption, headline, graphic, video or other material, we
      should promptly publish a correction explaining the change.</p>
    <p><b><i>Clarification</i></b></p>
    <p>When our journalism is factually correct but the language we used to explain those facts is not as clear or
      detailed as it should be, the language should be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification
      can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the
      story or that new reporting has shifted our account of an event.</p>
    <p><b><i>Editor’s Notes</i></b></p>
    <p>A correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or
      addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor’s Note and be followed by an
      explanation of what is at issue. A senior editor must approve the addition of an Editor’s Note to a story.</p>
    <p><b><i>Quoting Sources and Sharing Information</i></b></p>
    <p>Our objective in quoting people is to capture both their words and intended meaning accurately. That requires
      care in negotiating ground rules with sources. We do not allow sources to change the rules governing specific
      quotations after the fact. Once a quote is on the record, it remains there.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, a source will agree to be interviewed only if we promise to read quotations back to the source before
      publication. We should not allow sources to change what was said in an original interview, although accuracy or
      the risk of losing an on-the-record quote from a crucial source may sometimes require it. A better and more
      acceptable alternative is to permit a source to add to a quotation and then explain that sequence to readers. </p>
    <p>Some reporters share sections of stories with sources before publication, to ensure accuracy on technical points
      or to catch errors. But it is against our policy to share drafts of entire stories with outside sources prior to
      publication, except in rare situations with the permission of senior editors.</p>
    <p>In negotiating terms of engagement with a source, reporters and editors should be prepared for everything they
      say or write, in any medium, on the telephone or in person, to become public. They should make no promises, agree
      to no compromises and offer no concessions that aren’t compatible with this policy. Clarity and
      straightforwardness in our communications with sources is essential.</p>
    <p><b><i>Expert Sources</i></b></p>
    <p>We must strive always to get a rich variety of voices into our work. This means avoiding dependence on the same
      academics or public figures for reactions to stories. We all must look for new specialists - especially women,
      younger people, people of color, unconventional thinkers and people who aren’t routinely quoted.</p>
    <p>Similarly, we need to remember to talk to a broad range of individuals who are affected by the events we cover.
      The voices of ordinary citizens of all ages should be a regular part of our journalism.</p>
    <p><b><i>Reader engagement and feedback</i></b></p>
    <p>Connecting with our readers is a crucial part of AMT. Nearly all of our articles offer comment sections for
      readers to discuss the news of the day or provide comments on our work. </p>
    <p>Reporters and editors are encouraged to participate in comments, but the extent of their participation, if any,
      depends on their preferences. We ask commenters to keep their tone civil and readers and staff may report
      offensive comments.</p>
